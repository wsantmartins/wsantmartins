Hallo! I'm currently pursuing my PhD at the University of TÃ¼bingen, focusing on quantum thermodynamics of cold atoms, particularly trapped Rydberg ions. My research revolves around non-equilibrium many-body systems, atomic physics and thermodynamics, always in the vista of experimentally reproducible theoretical models.
